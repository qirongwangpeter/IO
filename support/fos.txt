Hi, today is 23th of December, 2025. I just arrived in China from the US. I parked my car in my uncle's home in Tyngsboro, MA, and went back China for winter break.
My uncle's son became a tutor at UMass Lowell last year and is currently conducting research on chemistry and biology. He gave me some guides on selcting my career based on my interests.
